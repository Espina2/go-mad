This project aims to have a tool that allows mysql repositories to be quickly dump in an anonymized form.

I have found numerous projects that strive to do somehow the same, but none gave me the tooling that would fit my 
requirements, which are, have a sort of faker and fill the mysql dump data with them

Notorious Projects that could do similar:
- [mysqlsuperdump](https://github.com/hgfischer/mysqlsuperdump), but hasn't had updates since 2017
- [mtp-dump](https://github.com/skpr/mtk)
